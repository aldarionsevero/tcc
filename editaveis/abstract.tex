  Currently there is a large market demand for the implementation
  of DevOps in their organizations as part of the competitive advantage
  strategy. The DevOps culture brings concepts and practices aimed at increasing
  the amount of software delivery in a short period of time with higher quality
  and safety. The Chef tool, one of the most popular automation tools within the
  context of DevOps is a facilitator for infrastructure orchestration, applying
  the concept of infrastructure as code. This paper proposes the implementation
  of a tool to reverse engineering this concept, constructing scrips in the
  pattern of Chef tool from a preconfigured environment for a goal.
