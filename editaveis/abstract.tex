    Currently there is a large market demand for the implementation
    of DevOps in their organizations as part of the competitive advantage
    strategy. The DevOps culture brings concepts and practices aimed at increasing
    the amount of software delivery in a short period of time with higher quality
    and safety. The Chef tool, one of the most popular automation tools within the
    context of DevOps is a facilitator for infrastructure orchestration, applying
    the concept of infrastructure as code. This paper proposes the implementation
    of a tool to reverse engineering this concept, constructing scrips in thE
    pattern of Chef tool from a preconfigured environment for a goal.
